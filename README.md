# keyboardio-model01-tenting-stand
The 3D model for the tenting stand I use with my [Keyboardio Model 01](https://keyboard.io) keyboard.

I printed mine on a [FlashForge Creator Pro](http://www.flashforge.com/creator-pro-3d-printer/).

# Usage
You'll need to use [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) to generate files usable by your printer from the source `model.scad` file.

**Important note**: unlike the original models this was based on, mine is not vertically symmetrical, so you must produce 2 different (mirrored) models to print the left and right stands. Use the `build_for_left_keyboard_half` variable at the top of the model source to switch which half you're rendering a model for.
